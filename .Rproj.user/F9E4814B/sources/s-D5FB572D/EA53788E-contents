title: "Spring 2023 GPFFL Draft Cards"

## Overview

Here's a little site I threw together to help with draft organization! Using the `.csv` file that Matty provided, I generated a draft card for every player. The draft card includes each player's skill level, height and shirt-size above the blue box. In the blue box, we can see their flag positions and previous sports experience.
Each player's preferred pronouns are in the bottom right corner.
I also organized the player cards into lists, and I can add more upon request.
