## Overview 

(3) Forced Choice Referent Selection
You can preview the current version of the task here, if you're interested. (We'll be running two follow-up versions, manipulating the lexical prompt before the test phase.)

Task: 
Participants were presented with a brief video featuring a target novel word, then asked to use this information to make a selection between two referents at test. Only 1 condition run (so far).

## Statistical Analysis

In order to find the probability of choosing an animate referent, a binomial logistic regression was run.
The fixed effect predictor was condition (8 levels: 
blickets (count N), daxy-about DP, wilpy-of…because,  spoovy-that, troby-about gerund, brispy-at…because,  larpy-to VP, roaking (transitive).
All model priors were the default in `brms`, a student's T distribution with 3 degree of freedom. All models were fit with 4000 iterations (1000 warm-up). Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampling was carried out with 6 chains distributed between 6 processing cores

**-compare each target adjective trial to chance level (chance=.5, likeliness to guess emot. adj)**

@fig-ind shows the probability of choosing an animate referent in each condition.
Almost every condition is reliably choosing the animate referent above chance.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ind
#| fig-cap: "Individual probability of choosing the animate referent"
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "plots", "ind_prob.png"))

```

**-compare target trials in aggregate to chance level (chance=.5, likeliness to guess emot. adj)**

@fig-agg shows the aggregate of these individual estimates. 
Overall, the probability of choosing the animate referent was .78 [95% HDI .72-.84].

```{r}
#| label: fig-agg
#| fig-cap: "Aggregate probability of choosing the animate referent"
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "plots", "aggregate_prob.png"))

```

**-compare across target adjective trials (Chi-sq, more restrictive/informative frames?)**

I am unsure about this - How is it different from 1?
